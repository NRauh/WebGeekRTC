## Web Geeks Dojo

This project is an example of converting a custom site from Bootstrap v3 to Bootstrap v4. It is also a base project to be used in our WebRTC project.

### How do I get set up?
* run `npm install`
* ~~run `gulp`~~
* run `npm start`

* Making edits to SASS can be automatically compiled by running `gulp watch`

### Possible improvements
* Input and see a chat log
* Send audio without hearing self audio
* Mute self
* Mute other person
* Turn off self camera
* Turn off other camera
* Handle disconnected connection better than a frozen frame
* Allow more than two people in a chat
* Allow people to have their own chatroom (and a way to lock those rooms)
* Let people save their ID and have a contact list
* Alert people on incoming call
* Stylize alerts and stuff
