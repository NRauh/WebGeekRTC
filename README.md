### How do I get set up? ###

* #Summary of set up#
* Nothing is really needed. You can just load the index file and you're off.
* If you would like to use my custom styles you will need SASS. Compile your SASS by running this command from your root project folder:
- `sass --watch stylesheets/sass:stylesheets`
